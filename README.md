## A Real-Time Pedestrian Tracking and Action Recognition System

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a real-time system for tracking pedestrians in video streams and recognizing their actions using a combination of Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system is designed to be modular and configurable, allowing easy integration with different datasets and model configurations.
